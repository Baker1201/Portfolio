        <p>As the Editor-in-Chief of the International Creative Writing Society at the University of York from September 2018 to June 2021, I was responsible for ensuring the smooth running of the production schedule for an annual anthology of international creative work. I sub-edited, proofread, and compiled approximately 300 submissions into book proofs, enhancing the overall quality of the published material.</p>
        <p>In addition to my editorial responsibilities, I designed the ICWS website, along with various marketing materials and digital content. I also project-managed a committee of peers and international contacts, overseeing tasks ranging from organizing an international literary festival to commissioning articles and tracking expenses.</p>
        <p>Through a tailored content strategy, I was able to maximize discoverability and increase social media engagement by 811%, significantly expanding our audience and fostering a vibrant community of writers and readers.</p>

    <!-- Literature Dissertation -->
    <div class="portfolio-item">
        <h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-5XWPpVtsYut0G0MglSNKJAdRoN5DLL/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=106033395613490057097&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Literature Dissertation</a></h3>
        <p>My dissertation, titled "Immersive Metaphors of Reading In Narrative Theory," investigates the pervasive metaphors of immersion in reading experiences. I argue that while the immersive understanding of narrative is often viewed as intuitive, many metaphors surrounding it are contradictory and fundamentally alter how we discuss narrative experiences.</p>
        <p>The work is divided into several key chapters: 
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1: Immersion into Fictional Worlds</li>
            <li>Chapter 2: Immersion as Mind-Reading</li>
            <li>Chapter 3: Immersion as a Fantasy Performance</li>
        </ul>
        Each chapter unravels different aspects of narrative immersion, challenging mainstream definitions and exploring their implications on reader experience and critical reception.</p>
        <p>This analysis draws on significant literary theories and aims to uncover the invisible assumptions that shape our understanding of narrative and its immersive qualities. You can view the full dissertation <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-5XWPpVtsYut0G0MglSNKJAdRoN5DLL/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=106033395613490057097&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Freelance Assistant Editor, <a href="https://therecordpress2020.wixsite.com/website" target="_blank">The Record Press</a></h3>
        <p>As a Freelance Assistant Editor for The Record Press, I have been writing in-depth musical features and timely industry news pieces for both online and print formats since June 2021. I commission reviews for new local artists, overseeing their stylistic development to ensure consistency and quality across our publications.</p>

My design work includes creating print magazine spreads in InDesign that highlight key pull quotes, incorporate high-quality images, and engagingly draw upon the thematic content of the pieces.</p>
