    <h2>Editing Sample</h2>
    <div class="editing-sample">
        <h3>Before:</h3>
        <p>M walked across the <strong>balcolny</strong>. Her feet made almost no sound, but her mind was a mess of <strong>noisey</strong> thoughts.<br>
        In her victim’s room, her eyes looked around, trying to find her victim.<br>
        The walls seemed to get closer, a heavy pressure on her chest. If she didn't calm down, she might ruin everything. She <strong>blinkd</strong>, forcing her eyes to get used to the darkness. Thanks to her training, her mind was sharp like a sword, ready to get the job done.<br>
        As she moved closer, M could see the shape of the person <strong>sleping</strong>, they were breathing quiet and still. So she attacked them!</p>

        <h3>After:</h3>
        <p>May tiptoed across the balcony. While her movements were quiet, her mind screamed.<br>
        A hurricane of thoughts wheeled her into the sleeping apartment. Her eyes whipped around the room, searching for an anchor in the dark abyss.<br>
        The walls pressed closer, a weight pressed on her chest. If she didn’t pull herself together, she’d compromise her position. Blinking, she tried to attune her eyes to the darkness. With her training, she honed her mind to a keen buzz until it rang like a freshly sharpened sword. Ready to cut through stone.<br>
        Creeping closer to the sleeping victim, May’s gaze found the shadowed silhouette breathing softly at her feet.<br>
        <p><em>Some people are so helpless,</em> May thought as she slid her knife free.</p>

    <h2>Key Changes Made & Why</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity and Flow:</strong> Corrected spelling and grammatical errors to improve readability and smooth the flow of the narrative. Replaced awkward phrases like "a mess of noisey thoughts" with more evocative language like "her mind screamed" to enhance immersion.</li>
      <li><strong>Character Depth:</strong> The author had a compelling idea of portraying *anxiety* as a character – one trained, deadly, and intent on destroying perceived threats. We incorporated this concept into the scene by subtly developing the panic attack sensations M experiences. The chest tightness and sensation of the walls closing in allude to anxiety’s suffocating grip, introducing this metaphor early on while maintaining the shock and tension of the attack framed as an assassination attempt.</li>
      <li><strong>Pacing and Tension:</strong> Reworked the pacing to intensify the tension, making M’s internal conflict more palpable. The original version lacked urgency, so we used sharper, sensory-rich language to reflect her anxiety-driven state, building suspense leading up to the climax.</li>
      <li><strong>Descriptive Precision:</strong> Vague descriptions were replaced with more detailed, evocative imagery. This not only sharpened the action but also emphasized the connection between M’s inner turmoil and her physical actions, reflecting her struggle with anxiety through visceral, precise language.</li>
    </ul>
